# UCLA_HW_1
Here is a general overview for where I began my refactoring:
arranged the file visually so that it was clear where each logical section began
demonstrated how each child element related to its parent element
made sure to clearly show the beginning and end of each element
Added comments to illustrate where large wrappers began
I removed redundancies within CSS

I then used the web accessibility evaluation tool WAVE to spot the following errors so that i might correct them:
I added (and visually hid) an h1 element for formatting purposes
I supplied alternate text to seven images that where missing said text
I provided alternate text to seven image links that were missing said text
I provided alternate text to an image button missing said text
I provided label text for three missing form labels
I added text to empty links
